# BareBonesCheatInterpreter
An "interpreter" for Bare Bones, converting code into Python for execution.

It's an interpeter, I swear. It definitely _doesn't_ compile the Bare Bones code to Python, and definitely _doesn't_ use the Python interpreter to run the code. 

It's an interpreter with extra steps. Definitely not a compiler.

Shh.
